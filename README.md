# Bloxburg-Fisherman-AutoWorker
I made this because I was bored and then worked on it for around 12 hours straight, and when I finished, I realized that this is a kids game and that I will probably never use it. But if yuou want to use it be my guest


## Tutorial

-- First you need to get the fisherman job, I would recommend having all of your moods up

-- Go around here

-- When you are around there, stand about this far away from the water

Put your camera in the water, put your fisherpole bobber in the water, and adjust the camera so you can see the bobber not when it is up, but when it comes down in the water

-- Lastly run the Fisherman.exe and hover your cursur over this
